# Collaborative Filtering Project
Tasks:
1. Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm (from scratch) on the MovieLens 1M Dataset available here.
2. For evaluating the method, use a random training set containing 90% of the available ratings and report the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the remaining 10%.
3. Try several approaches and read the relevant recent literature on the problem.
